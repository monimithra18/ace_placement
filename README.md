# TPO_website
Since last week was Programmer's day so me and my team Dhruv Desai Hrithik Chauhan planned to design a website for Training and Placement Cell. We had designed with the help of Django as a back-end and Bulma(which is a CSS framework).

->Our project consists of sign in and login page for students as well for admin.

->Then comes the upcoming events section where the students can login for the events such as Training for Internships, Machine Learning, AR/VR and so on.

->Then it displays the list of current companies where you can apply for the role that you wished for.

->Also, it shows the results of the current rounds of the company.

-> We have also designed statistics of the previous years using chart.js and the user can also download the report of previous years.

->Lastly, we have implemented a chatbot so that the students can ask any questions regarding placement and current companies rounds, tentative dates or package.
